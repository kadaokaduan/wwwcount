Two utility programs mkstrip.exe and extdgts.exe are also copied
to your CGI directory. Please move them out of there to somewhere 
in your path. They do not belong there.

mkstrip.exe - creates strip.gif from individual digit images
extdgts.exe - extract individual digit images from strip.gif

Please read the documentation and look at the Examples and
Options section for help. The documentation is available at:

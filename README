The Count program is a standard CGI program to count raw access hits in web
pages. This is a graphic counter, that means it only counts if the browser
support graphics.  It keeps the hits in text file. The program tries to 
maintain data integrity by locking the datafile. Among it's many features,
it also can be used to show time, date (of any timezone in the world),
and countdown to a date.

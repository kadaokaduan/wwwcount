The script "mirror_count.sh" can be used to mirror the WWW Homepage Counter
homepage (http://www.muquit.com/muquit/software/Count/Count.html). It uses 
the program "wget" to retrive the pages.

The script can be used from command line or as a cron job. To setup a
cron job to check the coutner pages at 12 midnight US EST, put the
following line in the crontab file.

0 0 * * * /usr/local/etc/Counter/utils/mirror_count.sh

To edit crontab file, just type: crontab -e
you'll be in your editor (usually vi by default). Add the line at the
end of the file. save and quit. :wq
To check the cron entry, type; crontab -l

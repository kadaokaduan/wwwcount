<blockquote>
A shell script is provided to test out the various features of counter.
To test the program, at the shell prompt, type:
<pre>
    cd tests
    ./testcount-sh
</pre>
The program will create a file called <b>Count2_5-ex.html</b>. Load this file
to your web browser to see the result of the tests.
<p>
You can test it out in NT as well, provided you installed the tools from
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/">GNU-Win32  project</a>
by <a href="http://www.cygnus.com/">Cygnus</a>. These tools provide
a fairly complete Unix-like environment in NT and they're free.

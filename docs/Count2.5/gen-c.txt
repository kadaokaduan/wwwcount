$ make cfg
(sh Gen-conf)
    Welcome to the conf file generation procedure of Count 2.5

    This program creates a workable conf file for your host only, you have
    to edit it by hand if you want to add other hosts. The file will have
    enough comments in it to help you out. You also have to hand edit it
    if you want to use netmasks to mask out a entire network or a specific
    range of hosts in a network.

    First of all you must know your 
        1) fully qualified domain name (FQDN), for example,
            if your hostname is foo and your domain name is bar.com,
            then your FQDN is
            foo.bar.com

        2) IP address of your host, for example, 
            192.165.155.2 

        3) If your host has any nickname defined, for example,
            www.foo.com. Note, th nick name also has to be a FQDN.

Continue [y|n]? y
        
    No Error checking will be done with your hostname, therefore,
    you better make sure you are entering the fully qualified domain name.
          
* Enter your fully qualified domain name [no default]: abcd.foo.com

    No Error checking will be done with your IP address, therefore,
    you better make sure you are entering the correct IP address.

* Enter your IP address [no default]: 131.249.1.100

* Does your host have any nickname [y|n]:? y
* Enter your host's nickname (FQDN) [no default]: www.foo.com
    
    Now you need to decide if you will allow the users to create datafiles
    for them automatically. If you allow, the counter datafile will be
    created for the user if it does not exist and a pre-determined counter
    number will be inserted to it. If you do not allow, you have to create
    the datafile for each user, provided that the data directory has proper
    write permission.  

    Allowing users to create datafile is very convenient, as you do not
    have to be asked all the time when someone decides to use the counter.
    But the dark side of this is, anyone will be able create datafiles in
    the data directory. The decision is yours.

* Do you want to allow automatic file creation [[y|n]? n

    Now you need to decide if you want to compile the program in strict   
    mode. If you compile the program in strict mode, the browsers which
    do not return the environment variable HTTP_REFERER, will not be
    served, that is no access hit will be recorded, no time or date
    will be displayed. Instead, a string 888888 will be displayed. 
    
    The strict mode ensures that your counter data file can not be messed
    by accessing the counter remotely from a browser which does not return
    that variable. Note, good browsers like netscape returns this
    variable. Other browsers e.g. Mosaic does not return this variable in
    IMG GET method at this time.  This strict mode is experimental at this
    time!

* Do you want the program to run in strict mode [[y|n]? y
* Do you want to ignore access hits from your own host [y|n]? n

    Ok, do you want the users to use the file rgb.txt for color name
    lookup? It is very inefficient to search this file every time the
    web page is loaded. If you answer yes, the color name
    will be looked up and used. If you answer no, the color will be
    looked up but instead of the counter image, the RGB value will
    be displayed and the user will be asked to use the RGB value
    instead. This will prevent users to use this file. However,
    the convenience of allowing to use rgb.txt file is that color name e.g,
    red, gold etc.  can be used instead of cryptic red, green and blue
    components of the color.
    
* Allow using the rgb.txt file [y|n]? y

    You can decide if you want to allow reload count in your site.
    When a visitor reloads a page and if you decided to count reload,
    the counter will increment with each reload. It is a good idea
    to ignore reload count as it minimizes remote abuse of the coutner.
    Howerver, there may be situation when you will have to count reload,
    for example if visitors are coming through a proxy server. If you 
    decide to count reload, your users will have choice to ignore or
    count reload for their counters with "reload=T or F" options.

* Do you want to count reload [[y|n]? n

    You can decide if you want to log the counter error messages 
    or warning messages to the log file. If you are concerned about disk
    space, answer n to the question. 

* Do you want to log error messages [[y|n]? y
    You can decide if you want to show error messages to the browsers.
    The counter error messages are verbose and may reveal information about
    the system (e.g. full path of the data file or config file) in case of
    error. If you are concerned with privacy or simply don't care to show
    error messages to browsers (you are confident that the coutner works
    perfectly), then answer n to the question. If you answer n, then then
    if there is an error or the access is denied, the visitor will see the
    broken image (browser default).

* Do you want to show error messages to browsers [[y|n]? y

    Created conf file "count.cfg"
    Please look at it, you might want to edit it!
